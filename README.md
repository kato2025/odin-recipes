This is a part of my Odin Project training where i have to practice everything I have learnt. I have to work with HTML and then commit my work to GitHub. That is, i have to work with Doctype, the html tag, the head tag, the body tag, fully understanding parent and child elements, their tags and content. I deeply appreciate Odin Project for this course. As a teacher for 21 years, i find this course ne of the most interactive and easy to understand.
